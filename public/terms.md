# TERMS OF SERVICE
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025

**1. Introduction**

Welcome to GlobalPhone ("the Service"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and **ZedCubed LLC**, a limited liability company organized under the laws of **Wyoming** ("Company", "we", "us", or "our").

By connecting your wallet, initiating a call, or registering a phone number on the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

**2. The Service**

GlobalPhone is an application that bridges cryptocurrency payments with telecommunications infrastructure. It allows users ("Callers") to pay crypto-assets to connect voice calls with other users ("Recipients"). The Service acts solely as a technical facilitator for these interactions.

**3. Eligibility**

You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the full right, power, and authority to enter into this agreement.

**4. Contact Information**

For support, privacy inquiries, or disputes, you may contact us at: **globalphone@zedcubed.com**.

**5. Financial Terms & Escrow**

**5.1. Accepted Assets**

The Service currently accepts only **USDC on the Base network**. Sending any other token or using any other network may result in the permanent loss of funds, for which the Company is not responsible.

**5.2. Payment & Escrow**

When a Caller initiates a call, the full payment amount is held in a temporary escrow wallet controlled by the Service. Funds are released only after the call outcome is determined.

**5.3. Successful Calls (Payouts)**

A call is considered "Successful" when the Recipient actively accepts the call (e.g., by pressing a specific key).
* **Platform Fee:** For every Successful call, the Service deducts a **10% Platform Fee** from the total payment.
* The remaining 90% is transferred to the Recipient's wallet.

**5.4. Failed Calls & Refunds**

A call is considered "Failed" if it is rejected, unanswered, goes to voicemail, or if the Recipient fails to actively accept it.
* **Connection Fee:** A non-refundable fee of **0.20 USDC** will be deducted from the original payment to cover network gas and telecommunication costs.
* **Refund:** The remaining balance (Original Payment - 0.20 USDC) is returned to the Caller.

**5.5. Refund Processing**

Refunds are processed automatically by our system ("Best Effort"). However, due to the nature of blockchain technology (e.g., congestion, outages) or software bugs, automatic refunds are not guaranteed to be instantaneous. If an automatic refund fails, users must contact support within 7 days to request a manual resolution.

**5.6. Fee Modifications**

The Company reserves the right to modify the Connection Fee, Platform Fee, or supported assets at any time. Changes will apply to all calls initiated after the update.

**6. User Conduct & Prohibited Use**

**6.1. Prohibited Activities**

You agree not to use the Service to:
* Harass, abuse, threaten, or defame any other user.
* Engage in any illegal activity, including fraud, money laundering, or the sale of illegal goods.
* Record calls without the consent of all parties.
* Impersonate any person or entity.

**6.2. Toll Fraud & Traffic Pumping**

You agree not to generate artificial traffic, including repeated short duration calls or using automated dialers, for the purpose of exploiting the refund system or generating fees ("Toll Fraud").

**6.3. Enforcement**

The Company reserves the right to block any wallet address or phone number that violates these rules. We may report illegal activity to law enforcement if required by law.

**7. Intellectual Property**

The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of **ZedCubed LLC** and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of ZedCubed LLC.

**8. Disclaimers**

**8.1. "AS IS" Service**

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from viruses.

**8.2. Blockchain Risks**

You acknowledge that blockchain transactions are irreversible and that the Service has no control over the Base network. We are not responsible for funds sent to the wrong address, lost due to wallet compromise, or lost due to network congestion or failure.

**8.3. Telecommunications Limitations**

We rely on third-party providers (e.g., Twilio) to connect calls. We are not responsible for dropped calls, poor audio quality, carrier-level blocking, or the inability to reach specific phone numbers.

**9. Limitation of Liability**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, **ZedCubed LLC** shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or goodwill.

In no event shall our total liability to you for all claims exceed the amount you have paid to the Service in the last twelve (12) months or **one hundred US dollars ($100.00)**, whichever is greater.

**10. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution**

**10.1. Governing Law**

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Wyoming**, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

**10.2. Arbitration**

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Wyoming, rather than in court.

**11. Changes to Terms**

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

**12. Termination**

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
